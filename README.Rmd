# stagetrackr

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of stagetrackr is to provide a range of tools to optimise working with data from species which develop through multiple life stages. It can automatically assign the last observed staged for individuals in experimental datasheets and plot graphs of: survival rates through development; distribution of last observed stages with the ability to specify factors which are separated for the purposes comparative analysis.

## Installation

You can install the development version of stagetrackr like so:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("EcoHull/stagetrackr")
```

## Usage

The functions in this package are designed to be used in sequence depending on the questions being answered. But the base data relies on the recording of the dates that individuals move through developmental stages.

```{r example}
library(stagetrackr)

example_stages = c("Stage1", "Stage2", "Stage3", "Stage4", "Stage5")

example_data = dplyr::tribble(
~ID, ~ Stage1, ~Stage2, ~Stage3, ~Stage4, ~Stage5,
  1, "01/01/2000", NA, NA, NA, NA,
  2, "01/01/2000", "02/01/2000", NA, NA, NA,
  3, "01/01/2000", "02/01/2000", "03/01/2000", NA, NA,
  4, "01/01/2000", "02/01/2000", "03/01/2000", "04/01/2000", NA,
  5, "01/01/2000", "02/01/2000", "03/01/2000", "04/01/2000", "05/01/2000",
  6, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,
)

stage_assigning(columns = example_stages, data = example_data)

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
